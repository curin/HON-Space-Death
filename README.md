A project I worked on with [NickIndie](https://www.artstation.com/nickindie) for a game jam hosted by Home of Nerds in 2017.  Nick worked on the menu and some of the gun and bullet logic. I worked on most of the rest with bits of his help here and there. This project is not currently being maintained but we may return to it at a later date.
